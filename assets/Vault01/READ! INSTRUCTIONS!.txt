extract the 'vault' folder to 'documents' (you can put it anywhere but i recoment 'documents' for ease of access).
to avoid things getting messy and losing vaults, create your vaults in the 'vaults' folder.
press the 'create vault' button to create vault and enter a password (DO NOT FORGET PASSWORD OR YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN VAULT!!!)
all buttond are self explanatory.
